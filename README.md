# demo-cas-server

Authenticate users with the [CAS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.6.x/index.html) protocol by creating a CAS server suitable for production. Most app settings are within the `resources` directory (or `build.gradle` for more advanced customization).

## Versions

- CAS Server `6.6.1`
- JDK >= `11`

With the included `Procfile`, you can deploy the server on a hosting service.
